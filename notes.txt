inconsitent rendering issues were likely due to flask dev env
limitations. once i started serving with waitress all the photos were rendering
if its hosted on render it will have amore robust servering mechanism
to handle things. 

i wont be able to test the render endpoint 
from the frontedn unless i get an emulator on my mac, 
but that shit is def way too old. my work deksopt is good,

but the firewall blocks render.com
