inconsitent rendering issues were likely due to flask dev server
limitations. once i started serving with waitress all the photos were rendering
if its hosted on render it will have amore robust servering mechanism
to handle things. 

i wont be able to test the render endpoint 
from the frontedn unless i get an emulator on my mac, 
but that shit is def way too old. my work deksopt is good,

but the firewall blocks render.com


user can only submit a street to be watched once. if they try it again it shoudl say only one watch session per street.

10 watch sessions per user?


some of the cams in the json have null values for the lat and lng. fix that 


fixed ^^^^



detect gridlock by stagnant cars (detection model sees same car not move for time), update gridlock watcher page

in the direct search, i want to show the camera they select and also the five nearest, toggleable
